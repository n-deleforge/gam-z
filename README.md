# Gam'z

> Version 1.3 :memo:  
> An application which group several little games as Tic Tac Toe.

## How to use it ?

You can try the app : https://nicolas-deleforge.fr/apps/gamz/  
Or download it : https://github.com/n-deleforge/gamz/archive/main.zip  
Or clone the git : ```git clone https://github.com/n-deleforge/gamz.git```

# Note for self-host

If you download or clone the project to host it yourself, then you'll need [**Little JS**](https://github.com/n-deleforge/littleJS) at the line 28 of `index.html`, at the line 32 of `game-hangman.html`, at the line 63 of `game-memory.html`, at the line 50 of `game-tictactoe.html`. Also, I do not upload the web manifest and the service worker on Github but they are still present at the line 5 and 135 of `core.js`.
